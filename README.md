# Code Institute - Milestone Project 2

## Memory game

The goal of the Memory Game is to remember the highlighted tiles. The tiles reveal themselves momentarily before flipping back over. Once certain level is acheved additional Cheeky monkey tile is revieled. This tile contains a picture of monkey with background identical to the highlighted tiles. Monkey tile is just a distraction and it is not a part of the pattern. When answering, once the tile is clicked the answer cannot be changed. Game ends with a win if all the levels are cleared giving us final score of 11. Game ends with a loss if player makes three mistakes. After either of the outcomes the game can be played again.
